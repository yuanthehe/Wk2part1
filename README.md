# Contact class test suite

1. Move the `test` directory into your CRM assignment.

2. Run the test suite against your contact class with the command:

  `ruby test/contact_test.rb`

3. Use the output from any failing tests to adjust your code in `contact.rb`.  When all the tests pass, you're done!
